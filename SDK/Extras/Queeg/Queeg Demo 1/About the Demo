About the Queeg Demo
====================

The current demo gives you control of a racer in a simple environment.
Use the arrow keys to drive the racer around.  The camera remains in a
fixed position with respect to the racer, but you can choose two
different positions via the "Special" menu.  The racer does not yet
pitch or roll; that will be coming soon.

The background image is low-resolution (128x128 per side) to limit
the download size of this package.  As a result, the clouds look a bit
blocky; just remember that we could easily swap in a higher-resolution
model.  (The same goes for the other models as well.)

You'll also notice a big ugly bright-green triangle.  If you "shoot"
this by pointing at it and holding the spacebar, it will move.  There
is no point to this, other than another test of the ray-casting 
function.
