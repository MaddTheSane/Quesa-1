Queeg has been developed primarily by Joe Strout <joe@strout.net> under Mac OS,
with some general help from:
	Kenny Grant <kenny@kagi.com>
	
Windows porting has been greatly aided by:
	Andrew Cunningham <andrewc@vasci.com> (using VC++)
	John Klima <klima@echonyc.com> (wrote QGDemoInput_Win.cpp)
	Kirk Haynes <khaynes@tampabay.rr.com> (using CodeWarrior)

Thanks to everybody (no doubt including a few I've forgotten to mention here)
who have helped make Queeg a reality.
