About These Files
=================

The files in the "Model Source" folder are the original files from which the
3DMF models for the demo were made.

These models were made with Meshwork, a shareware trimesh modeler:
	   http://codenautics.com/meshwork/

The "background.pov" model was also made with the help of POV-Ray:
	   http://mac.povray.org/
	   
These models are public domain; feel free to use them as you see fit.

Cheers,
-- Joe
